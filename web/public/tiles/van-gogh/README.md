# Van Gogh

Choose **Options → Tile face → Van Gogh**. The sixteen approved faces appear in hands, discards, melds, indicators, waits, agent modes, reviews and scoring. The preference is saved on this device, and the new faces are included in preloading and offline preparation.

The selected studies are A–B, E, G–J and L, plus green Moonlit Four C for 4 bamboo, green Triple Shoots A for 3 bamboo, green Garden Rhythm B for 2 bamboo, **Almond Branches (Characters A)** for 3 of characters, **Night Cafe (Characters B)** for 2 of characters, **Cypress Fields (Characters C)** for 4 of characters, **Blazing Dawn (East A)** and **Wind Ribbons (North B)**. Almond Branches replaces the earlier Painted Letters D. White dragon uses the later, simpler L. East wind K is excluded. The other 18 identities awaiting Van Gogh artwork use their Classic faces. Hidden tiles keep the shared back. The white dragon retains its own pale dragon under the normal dora ring and foil sheen.

The [preview](preview.html) shows the actual exports and a mixed hand. The [manifest](manifest.json) records approval, source hashes and exact crop rectangles. [Design studies](../../../../docs/design/van-gogh/README.md) preserve both original boards and generation prompts.

Earlier PNG sources are cropped losslessly. The newer green bamboo sources use documented quality-95 WebP game exports, without regeneration or repainting. The self-contained SVGs use the shared 300 × 400 canvas, 26-unit rounded corners and 1% bleed. Reproduce exports from the repository root with Node.js and ImageMagick:

```sh
node web/scripts/export-van-gogh-tiles.mjs
```

The 2 and 4 of characters use exact copies of their full-canvas source PNGs. To export only these two while keeping every other face byte-for-byte unchanged:

```sh
node web/scripts/export-van-gogh-tiles.mjs --only=2m,4m
```

## Garden Rhythm: green 2 bamboo

The approved revised green B is active for `2s` (`Sou2`). The two bamboo stalks, garden canal and bridge are unchanged in composition. The deployed 300 by 400 source is a high-quality WebP crop, with source checksum, original-board checksum and crop coordinates recorded in `docs/design/van-gogh/two-bamboo-green.json`. Earlier tile artwork is unchanged. Run `node web/scripts/export-van-gogh-tiles.mjs --only=2s` to regenerate this face. That addition brought the set to 15 painted faces and 19 Classic fallbacks.

## Triple Shoots: green 3 bamboo replacement

The approved greener **A — Triple Shoots** replaces the original C artwork for `3s` (`Sou3`), using the existing `approved/Sou3.png` and `approved/Sou3.svg` paths. Exactly three bamboo stalks form the tile identity. No other playable tile is changed. Original C remains in the first study sheet and Git history.

The source is a 300 × 400, quality-95 WebP export of the selected panel, not a lossless full-resolution original. The original board checksum, 439 × 673 crop coordinates and optimized-source checksum are recorded in `docs/design/van-gogh/three-bamboo-green.json`. Run `node web/scripts/export-van-gogh-tiles.mjs --only=3s` to reproduce this replacement. That replacement retained 15 painted faces and 19 Classic fallbacks.

## Moonlit Four: green 4 bamboo

The approved greener **C — Moonlit Four** is active for `4s` (`Sou4`). Four distinct bamboo stalks stand against the emerald and teal night sky. The committed source is a 300 × 400, quality-95 WebP game export of the selected right panel, not a lossless full-resolution original. The original board checksum and 438 × 671 crop coordinates are recorded in `docs/design/van-gogh/four-bamboo-green.json`. The original review board and full-resolution selected crop were also preserved in the downloadable approval archive.

Run `node web/scripts/export-van-gogh-tiles.mjs --only=4s` to reproduce the playable PNG and SVG. All previously approved artwork is unchanged, including 2 and 3 bamboo. The set now has 16 painted faces and 18 Classic fallbacks.
